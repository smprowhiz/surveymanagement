# Survey Management System - Enhanced 360° Feedback

## 🚀 Latest Enhancement: Employee-Based Feedback System

### Overview
This commit introduces a major enhancement transforming the survey system from abstract feedback types to an intuitive employee-based approach with comprehensive relationship tracking.

### 🔄 What Changed

#### **Before: Abstract Feedback Selection**
- Users saw generic options: "Manager Feedback", "Peer Feedback", "Self Assessment"
- No clear indication of who they were giving feedback about
- Limited visibility in response viewing

#### **After: Employee-Based Selection**
- Users see specific employees: "Give feedback for Emma Wilson", "Give feedback for Bob Jones"
- Clear feedback type labels: "Manager Feedback", "Self Assessment"
- Enhanced response viewing showing who gave feedback about whom

### ✨ Key Features

#### **1. Enhanced Survey Taking Interface**
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/SurveyTaking.js`
- Employee-specific selection instead of abstract types
- Clear feedback relationship display
- Intuitive user experience

#### **2. Database Schema Enhancement**
- **New Table**: `survey_rater_assignments`
- Proper rater-subject relationship mapping
- Support for complex 360-degree feedback scenarios
- Historical data migration included

#### **3. Enhanced Response Viewing**
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/SurveyCreator.js`
- Clean display: "Bob Jones [manager] about Emma Wilson"
- Submission timestamps on separate line
- Smart logic for self vs cross-employee feedback

#### **4. Backend API Enhancement**
- **File**: `backend/index.js`
- Enhanced SQL queries with employee joins
- Rich response data including rater and subject details
- Proper authentication and relationship validation

### 🗃️ Database Structure

#### **New Tables & Relationships**
```sql
survey_rater_assignments
├── rater_employee_id (who gives feedback)
├── subject_employee_id (who receives feedback)
├── feedback_type (manager/peer/reportee/self)
└── survey_id (which survey)

employees
├── id, name, email, role
└── Linked to all feedback relationships
```

#### **Enhanced Data Model**
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Support for manager-reportee hierarchies
- Peer feedback networks
- Self-assessment tracking

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### **Frontend Changes**
- React component restructuring for employee selection
- Enhanced API integration for relationship data
- Responsive design with clean visual hierarchy
- Smart subject display logic

#### **Backend Changes**

- Enhanced response viewing with JOIN queries
- Proper data validation and error handling
- Historical data migration scripts

#### **Database Changes**
- New relationship tables
- Data migration for existing responses
- Proper indexing for performance
- Referential integrity constraints

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

#### **Data Migration**
- All 36 historical responses successfully updated
- Proper rater-subject relationships established
- Data integrity maintained throughout

#### **API Testing**
- Enhanced endpoints returning complete relationship data
- Proper authentication flows validated
- Response viewing with employee details confirmed

#### **Frontend Testing**
- Employee selection interface working correctly
- Clean response display showing relationships
- Responsive design across screen sizes
