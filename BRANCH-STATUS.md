## 🚫 **Abandoned Branches**

### `survey-enhancements` - ABANDONED ❌

**Date Abandoned**: September 7, 2025

**Reason**: Dummy data management across merges messed up everything

**Original Goals** (from SURVEY-ENHANCEMENTS-GOALS.md):
1. ✅ Align Questions to Categories and Survey Types
2. ✅ Employee-wise 360° Feedback Display

**What Went Wrong**:
- Dummy data management became complex during development
- Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies accumulated
- Infrastructure changes (migrations, seeders) conflicted with existing backend
- bcrypt vs bcryptjs compatibility issues
- Docker environment instability
- Database schema mismatches between stash and working tree

**Final State**:
- Branch reverted to creation commit (9f8066b)
- Safety backup created: `backup-survey-enhancements-20250907` 
- Work stashed for potential future reference
- Goals documented but not implemented

**Lessons Learned**:
- Keep dummy data seeding separate from core feature development
- Avoid mixing infrastructure changes with feature work
- Use simpler development setup for focused feature work
- Consider feature flags for data seeding rather than environment-dependent logic

**Action**: Branch preserved per BRANCH-MANAGEMENT-RULES.md but marked as abandoned
