## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: SQLite (for easy local setup)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or above recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Run with Docker (recommended)

1. From the project root, build and start:
   - Backend: http://localhost:5000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
2. Login with admin credentials: `admin` / `admin123`.

### Setup (without Docker)

1. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```
4. **Run the frontend app:**
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3000 by default.

### Admin Credentials
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### Creator Credentials  
- Username: `creator`
- Password: `creator123`

## üß™ Security Testing

The application includes a comprehensive security testing framework:

```powershell
cd scripts
.\security-test.ps1                    # Run all security tests
.\security-test.ps1 -Verbose          # Detailed output
.\security-test.ps1 -ExportResults    # Export results to JSON
```

**Test Categories:**
- Authentication (4 tests)
- Authorization/RBAC (4 tests)  
- Input Validation (4 tests)
- SQL Injection Protection (1 test)
- Data Integrity (2 tests)

All 14+ security tests must pass before deployment.

## Sample Data
The application comes with:
- Preloaded admin and creator users for testing
- Sample companies and employees for demo purposes  
- Test categories and questions for development
- Secure seed data with proper password hashing
